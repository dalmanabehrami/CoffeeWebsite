                    We began offering online services and making shopping easier for our customers.  
                    Our café was born in 2020, a year that changed everything for all of us. While the world was going through an uncertain and difficult period, we saw an opportunity to create a place where the community could feel connected, calm, and supported again.  
                    Amid the challenges of the pandemic, we decided to open a space where every cup of coffee would be a sign of hope and care for our customers. For us, every coffee is more than just a drink—it's a chance to escape stress and create unforgettable moments, whether through a meeting with friends or a short break during the day.  
                    This café is a place where you can feel at home, where you can <span style="font-weight: bold;">enjoy your favorite coffee</span>, accompanied by a warm and comforting atmosphere. We’ve thought of everything—from selecting the highest-quality coffee to creating an environment that makes every visit special.  
                    Even though our beginning was influenced by the changes and uncertainty brought by the pandemic, our goal was and remains clear: to create a safe and welcoming space for everyone who wants to share a simple moment of joy in an increasingly fast-paced world.

                    We opened our <mark class="highlight">first international branch</mark> to serve more countries.  
                    Our café started in 2020, when the world faced unprecedented challenges. After a difficult period, in 2022, we restarted with enthusiasm and determination, offering a place where social connections and favorite coffee tastes could return. This year was a period of recovery, where our commitment to quality and hospitality stood out even more.  
                    In 2022, we helped customers find comfort and peace amid the uncertainty brought by the pandemic. Our space became a place where simple but meaningful moments could be enjoyed—a good cup of coffee, a warm conversation, and an environment that offered a breath of fresh air.  
                    Even though the years were tough, we remained focused on creating a welcoming and safe space. We believe coffee has the power to unite and create beautiful memories, and that’s what made this year unforgettable for us.
